I am a Tenure-track Associate Professor at the [Institute of Natural Sciences](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). Previously, I worked as a postdoc at [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory](https://www.pppl.gov/) (PPPL) with [Ilya Dodin](http://www.princeton.edu/~idodin/) before joining the [M3D-C1](https://w3.pppl.gov/~nferraro/m3dc1.html) team and PPPL staff under the supervision of [Nate Ferraro](https://w3.pppl.gov/~nferraro/). I obtained my Ph.D. in [Plasma Physics](https://plasma.princeton.edu/) from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/), where I was advised by [Hong Qin](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/hong-qin) and [Amitava Bhattacharjee](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/abhattacharjee), and my B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/). 

I study theoretical and computational plasma physics and specialize in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics (MHD). My most recent [work](https://iopscience.iop.org/article/10.1088/1741-4326/ac0b35) extended the state-of-the-art M3D-C1 code from tokamak to stellarator geometry, thereby enabling pioneering studies on the nonlinear MHD stability of stellarator plasmas. My [thesis](http://arxiv.org/abs/1708.08523) developed a variational integrator for ideal MHD and applied it to studying the formation of current singlularities. I am generally interested in advanced numerical methods, especially structure-preserving ones. I have also worked on other topics such as drift-wave turbulence and zonal flows.
