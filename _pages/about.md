I am a Tenure-track Associate Professor at the [Institute of Natural Sciences](https://ins.sjtu.edu.cn/) and [School of Physics and Astronomy](https://www.physics.sjtu.edu.cn/) at [Shanghai Jiao Tong University](https://www.sjtu.edu.cn/). I obtained my B.S. in Mathematics and Physics from [Tsinghua University](https://www.tsinghua.edu.cn/) and Ph.D. in [Plasma Physics](https://plasma.princeton.edu/) from [Princeton University](https://www.princeton.edu/). My thesis advisors are [Hong Qin](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/hong-qin) and [Amitava Bhattacharjee](https://plasma.princeton.edu/people/abhattacharjee). After graduation, I worked as a postdoc at [Princeton Plasma Physics Laboratory](https://www.pppl.gov/) (PPPL) with [Ilya Dodin](http://www.princeton.edu/~idodin/), before joining the [M3D-C1](https://w3.pppl.gov/~nferraro/m3dc1.html) team and PPPL staff under the supervision of [Nate Ferraro](https://w3.pppl.gov/~nferraro/).  

I study theoretical and computational plasma physics and specialize in three-dimensional magnetohydrodynamics.
