Stellarator MHD
======
The stellarator, one of the oldest magnetic fusion concept, has received revived interests recently due to the successful construction and operation of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) device. Stellarator plasmas generally have more favorable MHD stability than the more mainstream tokamaks, and in particular, are often found to be more robust than linear stability theory predicts. I have extended the state-of-the-art M3D-C1 code to stellarator geometry to enable pioneering studies on such nonlinear stability, which could potentially expand operation windows for present devices and improve designs for future ones. Below are a few snapshots from a preliminary simulation of a sawtooth-like crash on W7-X induced by a small amount of electron-cyclotron current drive.
