Nonlinear MHD simulations of stellarator plasmas
======
The stellarator, one of the oldest magnetic fusion concepts, has received revived interests recently due to the successful construction and operation of the Wendelstein 7-X (W7-X) device. 
Stellarator plasmas generally have more favorable MHD stability than the more mainstream tokamaks, and in particular, are often found to be more robust than linear stability theory predicts. 
I have extended the state-of-the-art M3D-C1 code to stellarator geometry to enable pioneering studies on such nonlinear stability, which could potentially expand operation windows for present devices and improve designs for future ones. 
Below are a few snapshots from a preliminary simulation of a sawtooth-like crash on W7-X induced by a small amount of electron-cyclotron current drive.

3D MHD equilibria with current singularities
======
Ideal MHD, in which magnetic field is frozen into the fluid motion due to perfect conductivity, allows for solutions with singular current densities, the formation of which can have profound real-world consequences. 
In toroidal fusion plasmas, this concerns the existence of smooth 3D MHD equilibria with nested flux surfaces. 
In solar physics, this amounts to Parker's theory of coronal heating by nanoflares. 
My results on current singularity formation are conclusive in periodic geometry (for toroidal fusion) while suggestive in line-tied geometry (for solar corona). 
Below shows that the current density distribution becomes more concentrated as the length of the line-tied system increases, but whether the solution will becomes genuinely singular at a finite length remains an open problem.
